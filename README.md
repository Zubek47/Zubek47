# About me

I am a student at a Faculty of Technical Sciences in Serbia. 
I have a background in music, having received formal training in both guitar and piano, though I wouldnâ€™t consider myself an expert in eitherâ€”just someone who enjoys playing and learning.
I also design games, primarily as a hobby, focusing on board games and tabletop RPGs. While Iâ€™m self-taught and knowledgeable in this area, I donâ€™t consider myself a professional, but itâ€™s something Iâ€™m passionate about.
My creative pursuits also include writing and story consultation, where I focus on developing grounded narratives and believable character arcs. I pay close attention to detail, striving to create stories that maintain the readers suspension of disbelief throughout. 
Additionally, I dabble in art, particularly with MSPaint, for creating simple yet expressive visuals.
